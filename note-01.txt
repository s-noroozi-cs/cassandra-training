Masterless 
    
    architecture and low latency means Cassandra will withstand an entire 
    data center outage with no data loss and Cassandra’s support for replicating across 
    multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and 
    the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. Failed nodes 
    can be replaced with no downtime.

    Cassandra is suitable for applications that can’t afford to lose data, 
    even when an entire data center goes down. There are no single points of failure. 
    There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.

Cassandra streams 
    data between nodes during scaling operations such as adding a new node 
    or datacenter during peak traffic times. 
    
    Zero Copy Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more 
    elastic architecture particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.
