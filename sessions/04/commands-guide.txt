docker pull official oracle images

    for example : gvenzl/oracle-xe:21.3.0-slim

following image work properly on CISC arch (x86 and x64)

    x86 family: Intel Pentium series, AMD Athlon series.

    x64 family: Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen series.

for ARM that subclass of RISC

CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computing
    CISC Models:
        Intel x86 / x64 family
        Motorola 68000 family
        DEC VAX
        IBM System/360
        Zilog Z80

    x86:
        Powerful, but generally consumes more power and generates more heat
    x64:
        Offers increased performance and memory capacity compared to x86, 
        while maintaining compatibility with x86 code. 

RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computing
    smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, and increasingly in servers.

    RISC Models:
        ARM, MIPS, RISC-V, and SPARC




for run x86 / x64 arc on arm processor using emulator

    Lima: Linux virtual machines

    to start lima virtual machine using following command
        $ limactl start

    then using nerdctl  - cli for containerd

    for simplicity define alias
        $ docker_lima='lima nerdctl'

    then docker_lima is same as docker , enjoy it.


    docker_lima run --rm -it -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=sysdba gvenzl/oracle-xe:21.3.0-slim
