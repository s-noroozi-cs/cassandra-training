the following issues inherent trade-offs in Cassandra's design philosophy:

* data duplication
* write overhead
* disk space 
    
We accept them for important reasons:

1. Multiple Versions of Data (Denormalization)
    Performance at scale: 
        Cassandra prioritizes read performance over storage efficiency. Having data 
        pre-joined and duplicated means queries don't need expensive joins.

    Query flexibility: 
        Each table is optimized for specific query patterns in a system 
        where joins aren't possible.

    Distributed system constraints: 
        In a partitioned database, joins across nodes are prohibitively expensive.

2. Overhead of Insert and Update Operations
    Write-optimized architecture: 
        Cassandra is built to handle massive write throughput despite the overhead.

    Eventual consistency model: 
        The system is designed to handle write amplification gracefully.

    Batch processing efficiency: 
        Multiple writes can be handled efficiently in batches.

3. Increasing Disk Size
    Storage is cheap: 
        The cost of storage has dropped dramatically, 
        making this trade-off economically viable.

    Horizontal scalability: 
        Cassandra makes it easy to add more nodes to handle increased data volume.

    Compression efficiency: 
        Cassandra offers excellent compression options to mitigate storage growth.


Contrast with Oracle's Normalized Design

Oracle's normalized approach solves these issues but has different trade-offs:

    * Normalization prevents duplication but requires complex joins for queries

    * Update operations are simpler but may require transaction locks

    * Disk space is optimized but may require more compute for query processing


When to Choose Which Approach

Choose Cassandra's denormalized approach when:

    * You need massive scalability

    * Your queries are predictable and known in advance

    * Write throughput is more important than storage efficiency

Choose Oracle's normalized approach when:

    * Data integrity is paramount

    * Your queries are ad-hoc and unpredictable

    * You need complex transactional support
