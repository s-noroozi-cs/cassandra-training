# Understanding `num_tokens` in Cassandra

## What is `num_tokens`?

`num_tokens` is a configuration parameter in Cassandra that determines how many virtual nodes (vnodes) each physical node will manage. It's set in the `cassandra.yaml` file and affects how data is distributed across the cluster.

## How Data Distribution Works with `num_tokens`

### 1. Basic Mechanism
- Each token represents a range of the partition key hash space
- More tokens = more ranges assigned to the node
- Cassandra uses the partitioner to map partition keys to tokens

### 2. Distribution Formula
Data distribution is roughly proportional to:
```
(node's num_tokens) / (sum of all num_tokens in cluster)
```

## Impact on Data Storage

| num_tokens Value | Effect on Node Storage |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Higher value (e.g., 256) | Node stores more data (handles more token ranges) |
| Lower value (e.g., 64) | Node stores less data |
| Equal values across cluster | Even data distribution |

## Replication Factor Interaction

### How Replication Works
1. The **first replica** is placed according to the token assignment
2. **Additional replicas** are placed on subsequent nodes in the ring
3. Replication factor (RF) determines how many copies exist

### Key Points:
- `num_tokens` affects **primary replica distribution**
- Replication factor determines **total copies** of each piece of data
- They work independently but both affect data placement

## Data Duplication Implications

1. **With RF=1**:
   - `num_tokens` directly controls data distribution
   - No duplication occurs

2. **With RF>1**:
   - Each write goes to N nodes (where N=RF)
   - `num_tokens` affects which nodes are chosen as primary replicas
   - Total storage required = (data size × RF)

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: Uniform Cluster
```yaml
# All nodes equal
num_tokens: 256  # on all nodes
```
- Data evenly distributed
- Each node stores ≈ (total data × RF) / (number of nodes)

### Scenario 2: Weighted Cluster
```yaml
# Heterogeneous cluster
node1: num_tokens: 512  # Will store ~50% of data
node2: num_tokens: 256  # ~25%
node3: num_tokens: 256  # ~25%
```
- Node1 stores twice as much primary data as others
- Replicas still follow RF rules

## Configuration Recommendations

1. **For homogeneous clusters**:
   - Use equal `num_tokens` (default is 256)
   - Provides best balance

2. **For heterogeneous hardware**:
   - Set `num_tokens` proportional to node capacity
   - Example: 2x storage → 2x tokens

3. **Special cases**:
   - `num_tokens: 1` for manual token assignment
   - Not recommended for most production deployments

## Monitoring Commands

1. Check token distribution:
   ```bash
   nodetool ring
   ```

2. View data balance:
   ```bash
   nodetool status
   ```

3. Check storage per node:
   ```bash
   nodetool cfstats
   ```

The `num_tokens` parameter gives you fine-grained control over data distribution while working within Cassandra's replication framework to maintain durability and availability.
