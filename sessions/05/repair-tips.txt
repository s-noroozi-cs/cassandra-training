Cassandra Replication Factor Increase and Data Synchronization

    After increasing the replication factor (RF) in Cassandra, 
    you have two options for syncing the additional replicas:

1. Automatic Synchronization (Eventually)

Cassandra will eventually sync the new replicas through:
- Hinted handoff (for short-term node unavailability)
- Read repairs (during subsequent read operations)
- Background repair (the anti-entropy process)

However, this automatic synchronization:
- Is not immediate (can take hours/days)
- Doesn't guarantee full consistency
- Only covers data accessed after the RF change

2. Manual Repair (Recommended)

You should run `nodetool repair` because:
    1. Guarantees full synchronization of all data
    2. Immediately enforces the new RF for all data
    3. Prevents consistency issues that could linger for months
    4. Best practice after any topology or RF change

    How to Properly Repair After RF Increase

    1. Run a full repair on each node:
        $ nodetool repair -full

    2. For large clusters, repair keyspaces sequentially:

        $ for keyspace in $(cqlsh -e "DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;" | grep -v 'system'); do
            nodetool repair -full $keyspace
          done

    3. Best practice options:

        nodetool repair -full -pr  # Parallel repair (3.0+)
        nodetool repair -full -seq  # Sequential repair (safer for large clusters)



Important Notes

1. Repair is mandatory when:
   - Decreasing RF
   - Changing topology (adding/removing DCs)
   - Nodes were down during RF change

2. Without repair, you risk:
   - Inconsistent replicas
   - Failed reads at higher consistency levels
   - Data loss if unrepaired nodes fail

3. New writes after RF change 
    will immediately use the new RF, 
    but existing data needs repair

For production systems, 
    always run repair after RF changes to ensure cluster health.
