Data replication 
    refers to storing copies of each row in multiple nodes. 

The replication factor (RF) 
    specifies how many nodes across the cluster would store the replicas.


    The SimpleStrategy 
        is used for a single data center and one rack topology.
        First, Cassandra uses partitioner logic to determine the node to place the row. 
        Then it puts additional replicas on the next nodes clockwise in the ring.

    The NetworkTopologyStrategy 
        is generally used for multiple datacenters and multiple racks. 
        Additionally, it allows you to specify a different replication factor 
        for each data center. Within a data center, it allocates replicas 
        to different racks to maximize availability.

Consistency Level (CL) on Write

    For write operations, the consistency level specifies 
    how many replica nodes must acknowledge back before the coordinator 
    successfully reports back to the client. 

    More importantly, 
        the number of nodes that acknowledge (for a given consistency level) and 
        the number of nodes storing replicas (for a given RF) are mostly different.

    For example, 
        with the consistency level ONE and RF = 3, 
        even though only one replica node acknowledges back for a 
        successful write operation, Cassandra asynchronously replicates 
        the data to 2 other nodes in the background.

    The consistency level QUORUM means it needs acknowledgment from 51% or a 
    majority of replica nodes across all datacenters.

    The consistency level of LOCAL_QUORUM means it needs acknowledgment from 51% or a majority of replica nodes just within the same datacenter as the coordinator. Thus, it avoids the latency of inter-datacenter communication.

    The consistency level of ALL means it needs acknowledgment from all the 
    replica nodes. Since all replica nodes need to acknowledge, 
    the write operation is the slowest in this case. Moreover, if one of the 
    replica nodes is down during the write operation, it fails, 
    and availability suffers. Therefore, 
    the best practice is not to use this option in production deployment.
