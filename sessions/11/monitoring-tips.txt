Monitoring Terminologies

    JVM Based Monitoring
        JMX

    Metrics
        JVM
            Garbage Collector Metrics
            Memory Metrics
            Threadpool Metrics
        Cassandra
            Table Metrics 
                Partition Size
                Tombstone Scanned
                SSTable Per Read
            Throughput
                Read  RPS : Client reads per second.
                Write RPS : Client writes per second.
            Latency
                Latency often acts as the canary in the coal mine 
                and monitoring latency gives you an early warning 
                about upcoming performance bottlenecks or a shift 
                in usage patterns. Latency can be impacted by 
                disk access, network latency or replication configuration.

                    * Total Read latency
                        Total response latency summed over all read requests.

                    * Total Write latency
                        Total response latency summed over all write requests.

                    * Read latency histogram
                        50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th, 99.9th percentile values of read latency.

                    * Write latency histogram
                        50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th, 99.9th percentile values of write latency.
            Compaction
                Completed compactions rate: Compaction tasks completed per second.
                Compaction tasks pending: Total pending compaction tasks in queue.
                Compaction data rate: Compaction rate


        System Metrics
            Disk Usage
            CPU Usage

Monitoring tools
    
    Prometheus
        handling time-series based data
    
    Grafana
        visualize any time-series metrics
    
    Cassandra Exporter
        collect and publish metrics
        replacement for the JMX metrics
