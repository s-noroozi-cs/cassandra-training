Heap Size

    Set the heap size appropriately. 
    Too small a heap can lead to frequent GC, 
    while too large a heap can result in long GC pauses. 
    The recommended heap size is 8â€“16 GB.

    # Example settings in cassandra-env.sh
    MAX_HEAP_SIZE="16G"
    HEAP_NEWSIZE="4G"

Garbage Collection

    Use the G1 Garbage Collector.
    G1 provides better performance and predictability 
    for large heaps.

    # Example settings in cassandra-env.sh
    JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -XX:+UseG1GC"
    JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200"
