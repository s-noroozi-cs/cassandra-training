concurrent_reads and concurrent_writes
    
    These settings control the number of 
    concurrent read and write operations. 
    Set them based on the number of CPU cores.

        concurrent_reads: 32
        concurrent_writes: 32

memtable_flush_writers

    This setting controls the number of memtable flush writers. 
    It should be set to the number of CPU cores.

        memtable_flush_writers: 4

commitlog_sync and commitlog_sync_period_in_ms

    These settings control how often the commit log is synced to disk. 
    batch provides the highest durability, 
    while periodic can offer better performance.

        commitlog_sync: periodic
        commitlog_sync_period_in_ms: 10000  # Sync every 10 seconds
