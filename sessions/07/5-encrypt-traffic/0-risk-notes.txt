  1. start cassandra with enable authentication and authorization

    solution 1-4 support it

  2. using tcp dump to see traffic

    on mac os  - on other OS maybe some parameter was different

      ifconfig to know interface

      netstat to list listen port ( after listen keyword, section 3)

        netstat -anv -p tcp   | grep 9042

      ps to know detail of process 

        ps aux | grep pid

      using tcp dump ascii output to see content of traffic

        sudo tcpdump -i any port 9042 -A -nn -l > /tmp/tcpdump.txt

      now you see clearly content of service port traffic 
        and also easily know password and user name

      to fix it , should be encrypt traffic using tls  

Securing Communication
  Beyond authentication and authorization, 
  securing communication between nodes is critical. 
  Configuring SSL/TLS encryption ensures that data transmitted 
  over the network is protected against eavesdropping 
  and man-in-the-middle attacks.


Remember that enabling TLS will add some CPU overhead 
  to your Cassandra operations, 
  so monitor performance after implementation.


------ Risks that should be handle
1. Craft internode messages 
    to insert users into authentication schema

2. Craft internode messages 
    to truncate or drop schema

3. Use tools such as sstableloader 
    to overwrite system_auth tables

4. Attach to the cluster directly 
    to capture write traffic
