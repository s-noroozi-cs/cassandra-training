-----> /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml

authenticator: PasswordAuthenticator
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer


using env docker container

CASSANDRA_AUTHENTICATOR=PasswordAuthenticator
CASSANDRA_AUTHORIZER=CassandraAuthorizer


start cassandra container with exposed 9042 port
    and also define authentication connfiguration

start new container that only contain cqlsh 
    and try to connect first container

using ss -tupln 
or using docker inspect cas | grep -i ipaddress
to find ip address


Why Authenticator/Authorizer Aren't Supported via Env Vars

    1. Security Implications: 
        Authentication setup requires coordinated changes to 
        multiple components and initial user creation, 
        which is more complex than simple configuration.

    2. Bootstrapping Problem: 
        The default cassandra superuser needs to be created 
        before authentication is enabled, creating a 
        chicken-and-egg situation.

    3. Configuration Order: 
        These settings affect how Cassandra starts up at 
        the most fundamental level, before most other services 
        initialize.

    4. Historical Reasons: 
        The env var configuration system was added incrementally, 
        and these sensitive settings were intentionally excluded.
