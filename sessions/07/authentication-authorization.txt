------ Risks that should be handle
1. Craft internode messages 
    to insert users into authentication schema

2. Craft internode messages 
    to truncate or drop schema

3. Use tools such as sstableloader 
    to overwrite system_auth tables

4. Attach to the cluster directly 
    to capture write traffic



cassandra.yaml

# - AllowAllAuthenticator performs no checks - set it to disable authentication.

# - PasswordAuthenticator relies on username/password pairs to authenticate
#   users. It keeps usernames and hashed passwords in system_auth.roles table.

#   Please increase system_auth keyspace replication factor if you use this authenticator.
#   If using PasswordAuthenticator, CassandraRoleManager must also be used (see below)

authenticator: AllowAllAuthenticator

CASSANDRA_AUTHENTICATOR PasswordAuthenticator


start cassandra container with exposed 9042 port
    and also define authentication connfiguration

start new container that only contain cqlsh 
    and try to connect first container

using ss -tupln 
or using docker inspect cas | grep -i ipaddress
to find ip address
