------ Risks that should be handle
1. Craft internode messages 
    to insert users into authentication schema

2. Craft internode messages 
    to truncate or drop schema

3. Use tools such as sstableloader 
    to overwrite system_auth tables

4. Attach to the cluster directly 
    to capture write traffic
