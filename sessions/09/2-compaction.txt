Compaction
    Compaction is Cassandra's automatic process of merging multiple 
    data files (SSTables) into a single, new file to optimize read 
    performance and reclaim space from expired or deleted data.

How Data is Written
    When you write data to Cassandra, 
    it first goes to the commit log (for durability) and then 
    to an in-memory structure called a memtable. 
    When a memtable is full, it is flushed to disk as a read-only 
    file called an SSTable (Sorted String Table).

The Problem
    Over time, you accumulate many SSTables. A piece of data might be 
    spread across multiple SSTables, the original value in one, an 
    update in another, and a tombstone marking its deletion in a third. 
    This makes reads very slow because Cassandra has to check every 
    relevant SSTable to assemble the most recent state of the data.

The Solution - Compaction

    1. Merging SSTables: 
        It takes several smaller SSTables and merges them into one 
        larger, consolidated SSTable.

    2. Combining Data: 
        During the merge, it only keeps the most recent version of 
        each row and column.

    3. Dropping Expired Data:
        It discards any data that has exceeded its TTL.

    4. Dropping Tombstones: 
        It can remove tombstones (delete markers) once the data they 
        reference is older than gc_grace_seconds.
