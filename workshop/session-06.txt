Apache Cassandra Multi-Node Cluster (Single and Multiple Datacenters)

    Configuring Firewall Port Access

    Selecting a Name for the Datacenter
        Once you assign a name for a datacenter, you can’t change it later.
    
    Selecting the Nodes to Serve as Seed Nodes

        A seed provider is one of the nodes in the cluster that helps Cassandra nodes 
        to find each other and learn the topology of the ring. 
        This is a required parameter for a multi-node cluster.

        You specify the seed nodes(s) for a cluster by configuring 
        the seed_provider parameter in the cassandra.yaml file.

        seed_provider:
          - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
            parameters:
              - seeds: "192.168.177.132,192.168.177.135"

        You provide the list of seed nodes as a comma-delimited 
        set of IP addresses (“<ip1>, <ip2>, <ip3>”).

        You can make do with a single seed node per datacenter, 
        but the best practice is to have more than one seed node.

      The num_tokens Property
        The num_tokens property defines the number of tokens Cassandra assigns to a 
        specific node. The higher the number of tokens relative to the rest of the nodes, 
        the greater the amount of data this node will store. Since ideally all nodes are 
        of equal size, you want all nodes to have the same number of tokens.

        The initial_token property is a legacy parameter that you must leave alone. 
        If you specify the initial_token property, it’ll override the num_tokens property.
