The Problem with Traditional Consistency Models

    Think of a restaurant during peak hours.
    A chef focused on strong consistency insists every dish must be perfect 
    before serving, ensuring quality but slowing service. Meanwhile, 
    another chef using eventual consistency sends dishes as soon as 
    they’re ready, even if they vary momentarily — 
    this speeds up service but risks quality dips.

    Traditional databases work similarly: 
        strong consistency prioritizes accuracy but slows down under high traffic, 
        while eventual consistency boosts speed at the cost of temporary data inconsistencies.

    Both models are sometimes ideal. Some applications require immediate consistency, 
    while others can tolerate a brief delay for faster performance. 
    Cassandra introduces tunable consistency, allowing you to 
    adjust consistency levels based on specific application needs.
