CQL Commands

    The capture Command
        The CAPTURE command will capture the output of a command and add it to a text file, 
        as shown in the following example:

        cqlsh> capture 'path/to/the/file'

        Once you issue the CAPTURE command, the shell will capture the output of all 
        subsequent CQL commands that you issue in that session, until you turn off 
        the output capturing with the capture off command:
        
        cqlsh> capture off;
