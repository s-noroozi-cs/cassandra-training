Optimize Data Storage for Reading or Writing

    Writes are cheaper than reads in Cassandra due to its storage engine. 
    Writing data means simply appending something to a so-called commit-log.

    Commit-logs are append-only logs of all mutations local to a Cassandra node 
    and reduce the required I/O to a minimum.

    Reading is more expensive, because it might require checking different 
    disk locations until all the query data is eventually found.

    But this does not mean Cassandra is terrible at reading. Instead, 
    Cassandra's storage engine can be tuned for reading performance or writing performance.
