# Why should you start with 3 nodes?
# It’s recommended to have at least 3 nodes or more. One reason is, in case you need strong consistency, 
# you need to get confirmed data from at least 2 nodes. Or if 1 node goes down, 
# your cluster would still be available because the 2 remaining nodes are up and running.


Cassandra Architecture

    Cassandra is a decentralized multi-node database that physically spans separate locations 
    and uses replication and partitioning to infinitely scale reads and writes.

Decentralization
    Cassandra is decentralized because no node is superior to other nodes, 
    and every node acts in different roles as needed without any central controller.

Every Node Is a Coordinator
    Data is replicated to different nodes. If certain data is requested, 
    a request can be processed from any node.

    This initial request receiver becomes the coordinator node for that request. 
    If other nodes need to be checked to ensure consistency then the 
    coordinator requests the required data from replica nodes.

    The coordinator can calculate which node contains 
    the data using a so-called consistent hashing algorithm.

    The coordinator is responsible for many things, 
    such as request batching, repairing data, or retries for reads and writes.

Data Partitioning
    “[Partitioning] is a method of splitting and storing a single logical dataset 
    in multiple databases. By distributing the data among multiple machines, 
    a cluster of database systems can store larger datasets 
    and handle additional requests.
